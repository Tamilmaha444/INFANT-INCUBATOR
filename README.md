# INFANT-INCUBATOR

The smart infant incubator consists of two major units namely control and sensing units. 
The control unit keeps the desired incubation conditions inside the incubator. And the sensing unit senses the condition inside the incubator which is caused by the controlling unit and gives the digital or graphical values of the incubation condition. 
These values then stored in data bases for the purpose of remote accessing.
